# AI Doomsday Toolbox

**An offline AI toolbox for Android that turns one phone, or a cluster of old phones, into a local AI workstation.**

Access our new wiki and read all about the app https://adt.manube.org/

Run local LLMs, Whisper transcription, image generation, distributed inference, dataset creation, offline knowledge tools, and AI-powered utilities directly on Android. The project is built for people who care about privacy, edge AI, on-device AI, distributed compute, and squeezing useful work out of old phones instead of leaving them in a drawer.

## Why It's Different

Most Android AI apps focus on one feature. AI Doomsday Toolbox goes further: it combines offline AI on Android with distributed inference, phone-to-phone model sharing, and workflows that can reuse old phones as a low-cost Android cluster or pocket edge-compute setup.

If you are searching for a local LLM on Android, image generation, AI agents to build your projects, offline AI assistant, mobile HPC experiment, phone cluster, Android distributed compute app, or a way to reuse old phones for edge AI workloads, this project is built in that direction.

## Highlights

- Offline AI on Android with local LLM, Whisper, image generation, upscaling, and media tools
- Distributed inference features for coordinating multiple Android devices on the same network
- Built-in Ollama manager, llama native chat, and remote summary tools
- Dataset creator that turns text and PDFs into cleaned, rated instruction-answer pairs with Alpaca export
- Termux + proot tool environment with install helpers, SSH workflows, in-app webview access, and file management
- AI agent workspace with custom tools, custom agents, and project memory
- Tama virtual pet systems with adventures, farming, chat, and persistent memories
- Android share-intent support for PDFs, videos, images, and audio files

</p>

### Dataset Creator

- Import `.txt` and PDF files

- Clean chunks before question generation
- Generate five questions per chunk using neighboring chunk context for better continuity
- Generate answers, rate the pairs, and export the best entries
- Export in Alpaca JSON format
- Customize the prompts used for cleaning, question generation, answer generation, and review


### Termux Tools And Ubuntu SSH Workflows

- Connect to the Ubuntu SSH server from inside the app, with host, port, username, and password entered manually
- Follow the in-app setup help for installing `proot-distro`, provisioning Ubuntu, and enabling `sshd` inside Ubuntu on the default app port `8025`
- Install predefined tools such as Ollama, Open WebUI, Big-AGI, Oobabooga text-generation-webui, FastSDCPU, and experimental A1111 workflows with one in-app installer button per tool or the new `Install all` flow
- Open compatible tools in an in-app webview
- Manage remote files with the built-in Termux file manager
- Optionally expose each service outside `localhost` when your workflow needs LAN access
- See the fixed service port directly in the tool cards, and when LAN mode is enabled the cards also show the detected Ubuntu LAN `host:port` target for connecting outside the app

**Note:** The Termux tool installers now clone the maintained ManuXD32 forks for Big-AGI (`v2-dev`), FastSDCPU, Oobabooga/textgen, and A1111 to reduce upstream breakage. FastSDCPU installation also prepares the shared MCP runtime, so MCP no longer needs its own separate install step. A1111 / AUTOMATIC1111 support is still experimental, but the current Ubuntu installer now uses Python 3.11, mirrored Stable Diffusion dependencies, clip import verification/repair, and disables the default SD 1.5 auto-download / repeated environment prep on first launch.

## Getting Started

### Join The Google Play Beta

If you want the easiest install path, you can join the Google Play beta here:

[AI Doomsday Toolbox on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.manuxd32.aidoomsdaytoolbox)

The Google Play version uses an Android App Bundle, so the installation is usually smaller than downloading a universal package manually. Joining the beta also helps a lot by improving testing coverage, surfacing device-specific issues, and making it easier to validate updates before wider releases.

### Requirements

- Android 8.0+ (API 26)
- `arm64-v8a` device
- More RAM and storage if you plan to run larger local models
- Additional devices on the same network if you want to experiment with distributed inference and phone-cluster workflows

### Build From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ManuXD32/AI-Doomsday-Toolbox.git
cd AI-Doomsday-Toolbox

./gradlew assembleDebug
```

For release bundles, the project expects Java 21 and the usual signing environment variables:

```bash
KEYSTORE_PATH=/absolute/path/to/your-release.keystore \
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk \
KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=your_keystore_password \
KEY_PASSWORD=your_key_password \
./gradlew :app:bundleRelease
```

### Models And Content

Models and large offline content are managed separately inside the app. The project includes workflows for downloading, importing, and organizing models and ZIM content based on the feature you want to use.
